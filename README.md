# Backpropagation_Math_derivation
Complete introduction to deep learning and backpropagation maths derivation. This repo also includes implementation of Logical functions AND, OR, XOR. 
* why we can not use perceptron for XOR implementation. 
* Activation functions and it's importance in forward propagation as well as backward propagation
* what are different frameworks available in deep learning
* Reason behind <b>Vanishing Gradient Problem</b>.
